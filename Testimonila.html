    <p>I always had that determination to complete my higher education in the US but I didn’t know where to start from.
        Browsed a lot of consultancies in all of Kathmandu but always returned home with disappointment as I could feel
        the sense of dishonesty and financial non-transparency. Instead, i ended up starting classes for my bachelor’s
        degree in Nepal itself. Fast forward a year, got a chance to meet Santosh sir through one of my relatives which
        then changed everything and when I look back writing this today, </p>
    <p id="more">I’ve come so far completing my undergraduate and graduate degree here at the US and working as a
        research scientist at a R1 institution currently. I was always hesitant with my English-speaking abilities and
        rate myself below par but Bravo changed my perspective on being confident and motivated. I scored a great mark
        on SAT and TOEFL to get good scholarship which made my undergrad journey so much easier. All thanks to Santosh
        sir and Bravo team who guided me throughout the application process</p>
