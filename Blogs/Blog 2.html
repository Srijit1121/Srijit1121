                    <p class="mb-30"> Last year, my friends and I—11 of us in total—went on an amazing trip to Sandakpur in Ilam, Nepal. It was a journey filled with laughter, beautiful views, and unforgettable memories.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30"> <b>Day 1: The Journey Begins </b> </p>
                      <p class="mb-30">We started our adventure early in the morning, excited and ready to explore. We took a jeep to travel, which made the ride fun and thrilling. The sun was just rising, painting the sky with beautiful colors as we set off. </p>
                      <p class="mb-30">After a long drive filled with laughter and music, we finally arrived at Kal Pokhari in the evening. The lake was calm and peaceful, surrounded by stunning hills. We took some time to relax, enjoying the fresh air and the beauty of nature. It felt nice to be away from the busy city. We shared stories and took pictures, capturing the moment. That night, we settled into our accommodation, tired but very happy. </p>
                      <p class="mb-30"><b> Day 2: Sunrise at Sandakpur </b> </p>
                      <p class="mb-30"> The next morning, we woke up before dawn because we wanted to see the sunrise from Sandakpur, which is famous for its breathtaking views. We hopped into the jeep again, filled with excitement for what was to come. </p>
                     <p class="mb-30">The ride to Sandakpur was bumpy but enjoyable. When we reached the top, we were amazed by the view. As the sun began to rise, the sky transformed into beautiful shades of orange, pink, and gold. We stood in awe, taking in the beauty around us. It felt like we were on top of the world!</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">After enjoying the sunrise, we took some time to relax and snap more photos. The beauty of Sandakpur was incredible, and we all felt grateful to be there together.  </p>
                      <p class="mb-30">  Afternoon: Return to Kanyam</p>
                        <p class="mb-30"> Later in the day, we hopped back into the jeep for the journey down to Kanyam. The ride was filled with laughter and cheerful conversations as we talked about our amazing morning. Once we reached Kanyam, we explored the area, famous for its beautiful tea gardens. We took a leisurely walk through the lush green fields, enjoying the cool breeze and the fragrant tea leaves.   </p>
                        <p class="mb-30">We also enjoyed some delicious local food, which was the perfect way to end our day. After a day full of adventure, we headed back to our accommodation, feeling satisfied and happy.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30"> <b>Day 3: Back to Biratnagar </b> </p>
                        <p class="mb-30">The next day, it was time to head back to Biratnagar. We packed our bags and hopped into the jeep one last time. As we drove, we reminisced about our wonderful experiences— the stunning sunrise, the peaceful lake, and all the laughter we shared. </p>
                        <p class="mb-30">The ride back was filled with conversations about planning our next trip together. Each of us had our favorite moments, and we all agreed that this trip brought us closer as friends.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Conclusion</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Our trip to Sandakpur was truly special. It gave us beautiful memories that we will cherish forever. If you ever get a chance to visit Sandakpur, don’t hesitate! It’s a place filled with beauty and adventure. We can’t wait for our next journey together!</p>
